I'm Luka, a software developer by trade and a wiki editor at heart. I'm a system administrator at @utdrwiki, two wikis documenting role-playing games by Toby Fox. I'm also the founder of @siwiki, a resource for students at the Universiry of Belgrade, where I did my bachelor's. I also do system administration and teaching at @pfe-rs, an organization formed to provide Serbian high school students with science and engineering education in the fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, robotics, and related fields.

I'm currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science at ETH Zürich.
