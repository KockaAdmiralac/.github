I'm Luka, a software developer by trade and a wiki editor at heart. I'm currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science at ETH Zürich.

I'm a system administrator at [Undertale/Deltarune Wiki](https://github.com/utdrwiki), two wikis documenting role-playing games by Toby Fox. I'm also the founder of [SI Wiki](https://github.com/siwiki), a resource for students at the Universiry of Belgrade, where I did my bachelor's. I also do system administration and teaching at [PFE](https://github.com/pfe-rs), an organization formed to provide Serbian high school students with science and engineering education in the fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, robotics, and related fields.
